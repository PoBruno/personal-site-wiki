> View entire change history of a file on GitHub.

## 1. Annotation/Blame
Most source-control systems allow users to view files in `annotated` or `blame` mode, in which each line or block of lines is identified by the revision and the user who last modified it.

## 2. Blame View on GitHub
On GitHub, we can view the line-by-line revision history for an entire file through the blame view. See the example below:
