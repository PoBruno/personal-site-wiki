## 1. Network Attached Storage
### 1.1 What is NAS?
A Network-attached storage(NAS) system is a storage device connected to a network that allows storage and retrieval of data from a centralized location for authorized network users and heterogeneous clients. NAS systems are flexible and scale-out, meaning that as you need additional storage, you can add on to what you have. NAS is like having a `private cloud` in the office. It’s faster, less expensive and provides all the benefits of a public cloud on site, giving you complete control.
