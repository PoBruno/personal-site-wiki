> Create AWS and third party resources with CloudFormation.

## 1. CloudFormation
### 1.1 What is CloudFormation?
AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to model and provision AWS and third party application resources in your cloud environment. AWS CloudFormation allows you to use programming languages or a simple text file to model and provision, in an automated and secure manner, all the resources needed for your applications across all regions and accounts. This gives you a single source of truth for your AWS and third party resources.

### 1.2 Summary
* CloudFormation is a way of completely scripting your cloud environment.
* Quick Start is a bunch of CloudFormation templates already built by AWS Solutions Architects allowing you to create complex environments very quickly.
