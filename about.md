---

This website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). All of the pages within this website are static. The whole site is mobile friendly, as it is implemented with [Responsive Web Design(RWD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). This site supports different screen sizes. You can view it on your desktop, laptop or mobile devices, like pad or smart phones. Most of the articles are created with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Check the [GitHub Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [kmarkdown Syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).

Here are some resources which helped me to build this website:
* Two blogs introduce how to setup website on Github, [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole).
* [Jekyll's official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
* [About GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-github-pages)
* [Tutorials](/tutorial/?n=tutorial&c=website&s=jekyll) for how to setup personal website with Jekyll.
